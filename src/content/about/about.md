Hey there! I'm Fran, an aspiring developer and Computer Engineering student at UADE, based in the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Technologies I have used: TypeScript, CSS, HTML, Python, Java, Tailwind, Docker, C#, React, Node.js, Bun, Nest.js, Git, SQL, PHP, Laravel, Unity

I like reading (mainly fantasy, Brandon Sanderson is a personal favorite), taking pictures. And probably some other things as well.

Feel free to reach out.
