## What am I doing?

Weird way to start a blog, right? I'm not usually the type to share much, so writing this feels a bit out of my comfort zone. But I've heard it's a fantastic way to connect with interesting people and boost job prospects, and honestly, that's exactly what I'm aiming for.

When I started thinking about building a personal page, I knew I wanted something minimal and simple, so when I came across [Chiri](https://astro-chiri.netlify.app/), I immediately knew it was what I was looking for. 

I’m not entirely sure what I’ll share in this corner of the internet yet, probably notes from projects, things I’m learning, and the occasional photo. If you made it here, feel free to say hi on [X](https://x.com/franmessina_).
